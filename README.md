# Finance Project: Deep Neural Network

## Supervised machine learning algorithm using Lending Club dataset.

## Project Implications
#### While staring into the future through a crytal ball is a myth, technology can help investors to seek true sight in their investment prospects. It is the financial institutes' dream to grasp the untapped knowledge what is the return on investment in a given project. This is an interesting project to uncover the risky versus the high-profitable loan borrowers in the ocean of dataset.

## Project Objective
### The goal of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model to identify which borrowers will payoff their loans. The project implications can be beneficial to the financial institute in risk assessments, whether the prospective borrower would default or payoff the loan. This model serves as the blueprint to decrease bsiness risks and increase profitability of the organization.

### Real life dataset by one of the financial powerhouses, Lending Club. Supervised machine learning deep neural network will be used to perform binary classification. In this project, the target feature or y-variable will be "Loan Status".

### This project will start off with exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and preparing the dataset for supervised machine learning - deep neural network from scikit-learn library. The end result included the accuracy of the model to predict payoff or default loan.
